# Hi, Iâ€™m Aarya ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m passionate about **politics** and **stocks**, always striving to learn more about how the world works and the marketâ€™s structure.

## Currently Working On:
- **Hult Prize** â€“ Developing a project that has the potential to make a real **social impact**.

## My Hobbies:
- **Reading** â€“ Always exploring new ideas and expanding my knowledge.
- **Learning about market structure** â€“ Deep diving into the dynamics of markets and financial systems.
- **Cooking** â€“ A creative outlet that helps me relax and unwind.

## Philosophy I Live By:
> "Failure is something that takes you somewhere other than nowhere. Embrace it."

I believe in **embracing challenges** and growing through the process, rather than fearing failure.

## About Me:
- **Ambitious, strong, and independent**â€”I push myself to achieve my goals and create meaningful change in the world.
